# valheim-server
This is a WIP collection of things needed to host a Valheim server

## Initial thoughts
My goal is to host a Valheim server on my Ubuntu 24 home server. I understand that SteamCMD makes that pretty easy, so this repo will mostly be a collection of notes and config (so that I can re-discover how it works after a few months have passed and I've forgotten everything).
